When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?  
  when  i want to share and when i want to have an online backup

  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

     because some changes made remotely are not permanent or approved. e.g if someone else is suggesting changes


     What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
      its allows you to comeback to the remote server and view without merging the local master
