How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
    i could see the difference but could not immediately tell what the error was.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
    it would help find bugs if new code is introduced.
    also maybe you can easily reuse code from different stages of development
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

   Manual commits allows you greater control of when to commit changes but has the risk of user forgetting to commit.
   Auto ensures there are always version commits but can commit innapropriate versions.
 Why do you think they work differently?
  depending on the usage. Git is mostly for programmers.

  How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
    its makes me alot more confidaent knowing i can reverse any changes i amake
    
    Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
     version control and see whether it helps me graduate from bieng a noob
